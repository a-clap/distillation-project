This repo is part of personal distillation project based on https://wiki.banana-pi.org/Banana_Pi_BPI-M2_ZERO[BananaPi Zero], with {distro-link}[distillation distro],  {embedded-link}[embedded background] and {distillation}[distillation process handling].

== What is this?

GUI baked with {wails-link}[Wails], {vue-link}[Vue3] and sugar-coated with {element-plus-link}[Element Plus].

Main goal of this project is to provide user interface for my distillation machine.

=== Frontend

Frontend, as mentioned earlier, is made in Vue3 + TypeScript. This is my first project based on those technologies, so please be understanding. Nevertheless, I had a lot of fun doing frontend.

=== Backend

Thanks to {wails-link}[Wails] whole backend is written in GO:

* data exchange with frontend:
** frontend -> backend: just calling backend's functions,
** backend -> frontend: emitting events
* communication with other microservices (embedded, distillation) are made through gRPC + protobuf.

== Samples

Just few screenshots, although still need some work. Designed for polish user, however multi-language is already supported.
